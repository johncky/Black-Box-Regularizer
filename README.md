# Black-Box-Regularizer
Ridge &amp; Lasso like regularisation for black box models.

Use one of "Noise addition" or "Dropout" to achieve Ridge-like regularization on any black box models

Use one of "Robust" to achieve Lasso-like regularization

A black box model is any function that takes (X_train, y_train) and return a function that takes (X_test) and return (y_test)
